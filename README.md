# AdventOfCode2023 Swift Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2023! In this collection, you'll find my Swift solutions to the daily coding challenges presented in the Advent of Code event.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions may not be the most optimal or efficient versions. They represent the initial solutions that came to my mind during the time constraints of the event. As the primary goal of Advent of Code is to solve problems quickly, some trade-offs in code elegance or efficiency might be made.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, you will need Xcode.

Each day's solution is organized in its own Playground file, named according to the day of the event (e.g., `Day1.playground`). You can run each solution independently.

## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December. To learn more and participate, visit the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2023) website.

Happy coding!
